## Diabetes Prediction

This was the main project for the course 'Decision Theory'. <br>

I was ginven a dataset (diabetes.csv) and i had to implement a number of classifiers in order to predict
the probability of diabetes. <br>

Full project description is available in Ergastiriaki_Askisi_DT_2019_20.pdf. <br>

The implementation is available in theoria_apofasewn_2.ipynb notebook. <br>

Note: There was also another part (Part A) in the project where i had to implement some matlab functions. THis part is available in Ergastiriaki_Askisi_DT_2019_20_Part_A_1041589.pdf.
